# phpcgi

phpcgi is responsible for processing requests to .php, .asp and .txt pages. Also, it checks whether a user is authorized or not. Nevertheless, if a request is crafted in a proper way, an attacker can easily bypass authorization and execute a script that returns a login and password to a router.
